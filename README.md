***Plant Diseases Detection***

* The New Plant Diseases Dataset contains a collection of images of healthy and diseased plant leaves. This dataset is designed to help in building models that can accurately detect and classify plant diseases. It includes a wide range of plant species and diseases, making it a comprehensive resource for training deep learning models in the field of plant pathology.

***Models Used***

To tackle this problem, I experimented with several deep learning models, including:
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
* VGG
* ResNet
* Inception
  
Each model was trained on the dataset to learn how to differentiate between healthy and diseased leaves.

***Model Weights***

The weights of the trained models have been saved for future use, enabling fine-tuning, transfer learning, or deployment without the need to retrain the models from scratch Due to the large file size, the model weights are hosted on Google Drive. You can download them from **(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MuinIGYNfHXseQFEkSl9uT1aiTs4tcgk)**.
